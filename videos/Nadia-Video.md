My entire academic life is slowly being taken over by Russia, but I really find it interesting so I was thinking of doing my project on the Soviet Union and how different historians went about doing their research that resulted in a plethora of different Soviet histories. I also want to see what factors affect historians’ biases toward this topic (i.e. nationality, political affiliation) and how much that contributed to their extremely different accounts. 

Am I kind of on the right track? I’m a little confused about this assignment.
