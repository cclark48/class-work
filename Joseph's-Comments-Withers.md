The crux of this article though is perhaps just get us into *"Thinking Geographically."* 

There were a few things that struck me as interesting but weren't really developed as much as I would have liked. Such as locale as a social construct, the effects of globilisation on place. I'm not an expert on the enlightenment so some of his historical examples came off as under developed and poorly articulated to the common reader like myself. 

But essentially I think I sort of caught on to the spirit of the article. 

### For starters, Wither's describes three components of geography (pp. 639)

1. Place - Grid location (long and lat) place is small scale regional space. 
2. Locale - where people conduct their lives
3. Sense of place - I liked the term "place consciousness" and Withers descriptive of a "spiritual dimension." (640)

### Where the article led me...

1. **History** is used to investigate *locale* and *sense of place*/what forms a places identity. 
2. **Geography** is much more than what informs the *grid location*/places on a map (its primary role), and it overlaps with history to investigate locale and sense of place. 

  - *sense of place* is an equally important part of geography as map location and where people conduct their lives. 
  
3. In addition, **Political science** and **sociology** are two of the analytical len's used to examine the internal and external relationship's in all three: grid location, where people conduct their lives, and their affective attachment to place.  

4. Digression: All of these studies clearly overlap and it's difficult to distinctly differentiate them into categorical bifurcations (excuse my inner Withers here). They overlap to the extent that the humanities should emerge as one singular study. That way you get a little bit of everything (all of the social sciences at least), that try to examine our past - essentially what history already is IMO. 

  - Like, a student could study the humanities but have an emphasis on say, sociology, or something. Each study brings something of its own to the table, and all of the same classes would still be offered, but this way the student could study an array of upper division courses that all have the similar goal: to examine our past, our present, and what makes us us. Regardless, the relationship between these studies is dynamic and co-dependent. I think this class has taught me that and would have been more valuable at the beginning of my undergrad in history rather than at the end. 
  
  
### More generally, I think the gist of Wither is two fold.

1. that geography, or the lens of place, is an important and valuable analytical lens when examining human history. 
 - But perhap's it is as easy to over simplify this concept as it seemingly is to convolute. 
  
2. Different views are held about Geography's purpose and its contribution's. By exploring these different views the connection between geography and history can strengthen. 
  - And again, to this point, Withers succeeds. 

Wither's didn't get the memo, however, that "an intellectual says a simple thing in a hard way. An artist says a hard thing in a simple way." The humanities are humanities, after all, because there is an art to them.  

I mean, "lake space, its regular epistemic dancing partner in geographical ubiquity and metaphysical imprecisionâ€¦" (638) Come on, man.
