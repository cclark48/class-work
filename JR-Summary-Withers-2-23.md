Withers summary
Part 1 and 2
• Discussion over the importance of space
• Space: The physical location
• Place: More than just space, other factors such as culture and social structures come into play.
• Withers discusses the historiography of space, varying schools of thought.
• Citing Relph: “The essence of place lies in the largely unselfconscious intentionality that defines place as profound centers of human existence.” (Pg. 640).
Citing Harvy: “Place, in whatever guise, is like space and time, a social construct. … The only interesting question that can then be asked is: by what social process(es) is place constructed?” (Pg 641).
• Citing Malpas: “It is within the structure of place that the very possibility of the social arises (Pg 642).
• Breaking down this debate: Does place create the social structure or do the social structure create place?
• Withers refers to three approaches to geography: 1, descriptive; 2, social constructionist; 3, phenomenological (“human existence as being ‘in place’”). (Pg 643).
Part 3
• Discussion regarding Agnew’s devaluation/revival argument, based on marginalization of place because of naturalization and nationalization, yet renewed interest because of globalization.
• Withers argues social sciences, natural sciences and biological sciences are dependent on location, i.e. “ecological niche” and “habitat”.
• Citing Carter: “Space is transformed symbolically into a place, that is, space with a history.” That local history helps create the place. (Pg 647).
• Metaphysical distinction from Withers: place as location vs. place as locale. The latter factors in social interactions and practices in its creation.
Part 4
• Withers discusses place and the history of science.
• The laboratory is a place in and of itself, with its own cultures and social norms.
• The Enlightenment and place: An encyclopedia uses political geography and its agencies and spaces as two organizational principles. 
• The importance of place comes in when considering the movement of Enlightenment ideas.
