I have to wonder if he is trying to state or that if it may be easier to state that History uses science. Genealogy, archaeology, and even art all play a part in the historian’s craft. Moral judgment plays a big part in history, you can see evidence of this or what could be known as prejudice through history’s writings. Maybe even the twisting of history for nefarious uses as the Nazis did fits into moral judgment. I like how Evans uses the idea that history is always being added to and changed due to new discoveries as a reason for it to be a science. It is stated in the reading that moral judgment is unavoidable and yet should be avoided at all costs by replacing it with historical facts. I have to think about this and wonder if historical facts could not also be construed as moral judgment as well
