##### Igger's and "New History" 

I thought the turning point's, when history was "professionalized" and again in the 60's when it changed in the wake of WWII, were interesting. 

"New history," is how Igger's terms it. This also made me wonder where History is today in other countries. We critique the west a lot, and rightfully so, but all whilst white washing other ways other countries write and study. People who are educated here and then move back to the Middle East, for example, take this style of Western self-criticism home with them and it is equally as dangerous. Like this book I just read about, the Ottoman empire and "every day life." The author relegates the fact that the rich in the Ottoman empire had slaves, that women were subjugated, and that their slave armies were comrpised of kidnapped ethnic minorities - to mere footnotes. And instead of talking about Ottoman life, blasts the west for slavery.  

##### Art versus History 

On page 25, Igger's quotes Ranke, and poses the question of history being more a science or more of a source of culture. But, for me, Igger's went on to fall short on defining the term "empirical science." This is where the reading led me, as I reflected on the term.  

##### Where the reading led me...


Studies and the extent to which they are effective at capturing the human essence, broadening our perspective, and helping us understand are, undoubtably, more spectrum than scale. That is to say, it's not one or the other visa ve Aristotle's quote about poetry and history. But both Aristotle and Igger's get the wheel's turning for me. 

In the long run, I think art outlives politics. Guernica and For Whom The Bell Tolls are better remembered today than the Spanish Civil War, or at least book's about it written by historians. Same with Faulkner and what life was like in the antebellum south. The list goes onâ€¦ 

In a similar vein, I read an interesting article recently around the question "what books could be used to rebuild civilization?" 

I wanted to add another condition. Either history OR literature. 

When I went through my collection, I chose literature over history 75% of the time for many reason's. But mainly, because Hugo, Goethe, Faulkner, Hemingway - they were there. 

When I picture Hemingway in Spain, for instance, it is vastly different than when I envision a historian, spending long hours in a university library alongside stale coffee and a ton of equally dry book's trying to research "historical truth."

I'm not saying in order to write a book about something you have to travel there. I'm just saying this is an aspect of historical writing I've seen only once that I know of in Jack Weathorford's Ghenghis Khan and the Modern World. 

I do, however, believe that at its best and truest form, History is also literature and not only a science.
