But seemingly, as he continues to draw parallels, it's almost as if he relegates other studies to fit *his* definition - one that is more easily comparable to history and therefore fits his agenda. Take his analogy of astronomy, for example, which he defines as "the science of how the universe came to be and what it is." This works for him, because his definition of history is the study of "how humans have come to be and what we are." Sure, that definition of astronomy might be fair, but it is merely one component of astronomy. It is apparent that Carr is cherry picking sub components of studies and generalizing them in order to fit his train of thought. He does this with sociology, carpentry, architecture, physics, and various other sciences. The question is, would any of these studies use *History* as a defining metric? 

He does go on to recant his suggestion, or at least one he quoted, that history has the potential to be precise and therefore the potential to be the "mathematics of human behavior," when he points out that science is not predicated upon preciseness but rather "enunciating hypothesis."

Carr then brings Geography into the fold. And while this is neither stated in the book nor even implied by Carr, it starts to feel as though history is not a unique study in its own, but rather a fusion of many other studies (e.g. anthropology, geography, philosophy, etc) - or at least, perhaps more so than other fields, one that can be defined as such.

In either event, Carr illustrates how historians have moved away from the dated ideology that history, at its best, could essentially provide a cultural cure all. And more towards a realistic notion that history and histoirans, in a scientific method, just focus on putting together what we can - *este es este.*

In order to crystallize what exactly history is, Carr dismisses quixotic definitions advanced by historians before him and he attempts to define the domain of other fields of study - perhaps so that through the process of elimination the borders of the history puzzle piece will be discovered, or at least made more distinct.  

Some of his comparisons I found themselves to be reaching, however, and were like saying because a bird and a plane both have wings and both fly in the sky, that therefore they are inherently similar, or of a same category. 

Carr back tracks, nonetheless, away from some of these reaching analogies, warning that they can be dangerous. He then plots out 5 objections to the argument that there is a categorical bifurcation between history and the sciences. 

His points for this chapter are outlined on page 78: He aims to tackles the duty of the historian, how histories shape the present, what history can/can't predict, objectivity, and moral dilemmas presented therein. These points are made in the context of sciences, and through a comparative analysis his main point is that there are similarities. Plus, these similarities withstanding, the field of history should pivot away from the literary intellectual and more to the scientist. 

History takes due diligence. We are all generalizers, inherently. And sociology has structural problems that inhibit its progress as a social science. These are all my takeaways from his first point. Carr is all over the place, but as his points progress his thematic concerns become more precise.  

Carr goes on to showcase bias. He does this through his writing, but also shows us through how he thinks. In his footnote on page 83, where he attacks a western idea - that freedom of thought fosters science - and argues that this is notion is very invalid because his (Carr's) beloved soviet union disproved that. The footnote implies Russia disproves this because they advanced scientifically while quelling political dissent? The author of the "free speech" quote didn't say free speech exclusively fostered scientific advancement. Whether or not his point is a sociological law, Carr continues to work against himself in small places like this.

Moving on. Carr points to the relationship between the past and the present, invoking in my mind the famous Faulkner quote, "the past isn't dead, it's not even the past." Also reminding me of Bloch, or even Mark Twain's "history doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes." Perhaps Fitzgerald's "borne ceaselessly into the past like boats against the current." This is a point he will revisit later and make it really work. 

Carr goes on to his third point and it comes off as a straw-man. He says that "some people" say history is useless because it can't predict the future. People probably have said this, but they are not cited nor is their argument properly introduced. 

The gist of his third point is that what scientists and historians are trying to figure out (predictive wise) are "not fundamentally dissimilar." 

Okay. In hindsight some of his points work more than they do on first glance. 

His 4th point is his strongest, IMO. 

The crux of it is how history rhymes. Russians, after their revolution, looked back to what happened with the French rev and Napoleon, so they opted against Trotsky who seemed to them Napoleonic, in favor of Stalin. History's effects on the present are interesting and Carr brings up intriguing concept: the ebb and flow of the present is constantly shaped by our perceptions of the past. Moreover, history contributes to the crystallization of predictions. 

In his last objection, I thought the analogy of the deck of the cards to be apt. But Carr's proposition that the historian refrain from moral judgements, even if it means not pointing out that say - that Bill Cosby raped 40 women - to be whitewashing. In my Cosby analogy, that is a important part about his personal life that shouldn't be glossed over. For Carr, it is not my place (if I was a historian) to make judgements that this is morally wrong. What If I'm chronicling the history of rape and celebrity? or of bill Cosby himself? what judgement am I allowed to make, beside the ambiguous term of "value judgement." 

The question then arises of the lesser evil for the greater good. And that these are abstract terms not for the historian to define. 

In essence: **make history more like science.** The chapter's progression starts off weak but through thorough inquiry proves insightful.
