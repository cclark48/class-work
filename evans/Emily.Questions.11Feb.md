In his chapter, Knowledge and Power, Evans addresses the viewpoint that any new historical insight was made as a result of modern political and moral discourse and not out of genuine historical interpretation (p 170). Do you agree with this concept? Or do you think reinterpretations of the past can grow genuinely? Evans asks the reader later on “where do you draw the line between all this and legitimate reinterpretation?” when discussing the post-modern approach to historical objectivity and is yet another layer of uncertainty revolving around historical objectivity (p 202).

Evans believes, reasonably it would seem, that scholarship suffers at the hands of moral and political aims of the historian and warns against the dangers of manipulating evidence to prove a point (p 188). This is reminiscent of our discussion on Tuesday concerning facts and evidence, and their appropriate uses. Taking all this into consideration, should the practice of writing history as a supported argument be abandoned in favor of a descriptive history? If such a route were to be taken, would historical insight disappear and turn history into a practice of mere curiosity void of direction? 

Evan’s book In Defense of History would benefit being named “In Defense of History Against Post-Modernists” instead. In the last chapter, however, Evans finally reveals his main point against post-modernists. How would describe his point, and do you think it was worth reading the whole book to get there?
