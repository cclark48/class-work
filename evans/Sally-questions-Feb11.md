Throughout the book, Evans mentions Carr numerous times.  Does Carr influence Evans' work?  For example, do you think Evans' idea on symbolism is similar to Carr's idea about nomenclature?  And what do you think Evans' really thinks about Carr?

Evans is against post-modernists for much of the book, but I was wondering if Evans is still not subject to the ideologies of the post-modernist due to the time period that he lives in.  Can one be completely against a theory of contemporary times or are they still influnece by it?

Why does Evans' take the entire book to set up his argument against post-modernists?

on page 151, Evans' makes a comment  that if he wants to learn basic info about modern European political history, he will not look at contemporary books.  Why is that?  Is he so against post-modernists that he refuses to aknowledge their work, or does he truly believe that non-contemporary history is better to explain modern Europe.  Do you agree with Evans'? What is better to look at (to learn about modern history) in your opinion?
