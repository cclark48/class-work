In This Corner . . .

	There were times when I was reading the Elizabeth Clark’s History, Theory, Text: Historians and the Linguistic Turn when I
	felt like I was witnessing a heavy weight championship fight, except instead of punches the philosophers of history were
	throwing insults at each other. Not unlike the behaviors exhibited on a middle school playground. Hyperbole was everywhere, from Carr’s comparison of objectivist historians as being in the Garden of Eden or a nudist colony and trying to get philosophi
	cal cover for their endeavors. Jacques Derrida was outraged when Claude Levi-Strauss stated, “the primary function of writing is to facilitate slaver.” (Clark 58) According to Clark’s descriptions of the warring parties there is a high ground to be taken
	and that she is arguing that this dispute bodes well for the historical profession.

Historical witness

	When I was twelve years old the Late President John F. Kennedy announced to the American people the presence of intermediate
	range nuclear missiles on the Island nation of Cuba, a Soviet Union client state. My home was approximately 200 miles from Cuba. Epistemologically this is what happened and we cannot get away from the event. The difficulty with the situation is that I
	had my experience with the situation, the sheer awesomeness of watching the U. S. Army line the beaches of South Florida with defensive bulwarks to prevent an invasion. The delight I experienced watching the constant stream of military convoys going to
	the Florida Keys. Then the onset of helplessness before the freighter turned away in the face of the U. S. Navy’s blockade. As I am alone with these memories of that event so are there millions of others who share a memory of that event but their internal
	experience is different than mine.
	History and the problem with the debate about the philosophy of history is one of trying to find the objective/scientific truth about that event. What were the causalities and ramifications? One group would argue that the causes and ramifications are
	almost indecipherable. Hidden in a barrier of language, cultural nuances, or just outright propagandistic falsification. However there is an example of history coming to the fore in this tale of the standoff between the Soviet Union and the United
	States. President Kennedy had recently read the Barbara Tuchman historical novel Guns of August and saw the ramifications of miscalculation when two opposing sides misread the others intent. This use of history by an intelligent leader spared the lives
	of millions of innocent people since his military commanders were eager to use nuclear weapons.
