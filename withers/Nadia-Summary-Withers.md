In his article, Withers begins by explaining how the conversation about space and place began. While advancements in travel and communication technologies have homogenized the world, a trend that many fear comes at the cost of culture and attachment to place, they have also struck up questions about culture and sense of place. He looks at different ideas and definitions of place and space to strengthen and understand the connections between geography and history. Historians clearly agree that place does play a role in the historical development, but they all have different ideas of its definition as well as its level of importance. This lack of consistency among historians regarding this topic makes it difficult to properly include place in the discourse surrounding geography and history. Despite differing definitions of what place is, there is a general consensus that it is definitely different than space because it has undergone some form of transformation leading it to become place. What mostly summed it up for me was the line “space is transformed symbolically into a place, that is, a space with a history” (647).
