By and large, the latter half of Igger's discussion centered on the evolving analysis of history in the Cold War era. A major shift for the study of history that emerged was what Iggers called "microhistory." It was a departure from the purely social sciences mentality of historiography, focusing not on the large, macrohistories of large societies, but to focus on the small, individual histories of people. He analyzed various nations shift toward this practice, and while there were slight variations to their approach, the general goal remained consistent: to study history through the collective understanding of the individuals of a nation and apply those observations to the larger narrative. 

This emerged as a result of the political unrest of that time period. With the decline of the cold war and the rise of individual political involvment and protest, political discussion began to shift away from general narritives to an individualistic perspective. This saw the rise in the use of public unrest and political discourse, particularly with issues like women's rights and civil rights. This parrelled the shift in historiography to give attention to those neglected groups. More historians began to focus on the individual histories of those groups to gain a better understanding of the greater societies and political contexts that those individuals existed. 

This also saw a shift in the methods used to study history. Instead of a purely scientific approach, more value was placed on the "life experiences" of individuals, as derived from personal coorespondence, accounts, "fictions or poetry", or oral histories. The historian would then use these microhistories to establish the greater narrative. Iggers discussed some of the critisims of this approach, as it opens the "truth" to a level of the historian's objectivity. He goes on to establish microhistory's role in the greater timeline, saying that it could serve to supplement the current study of history. 

He also analyses the varied rhetorical or language and its effects on history. Iggers is very clear in his belief that individual histories are shaped by the contexts of the languages involved, and indeed, the process of studying and presenting a historical analysis through a language offers more barriers and limits on the access to true history. To that, he offers an option of understanding the rhetoric itself, to understand the cultural implications of that the rehetorical conext offers. Through that analysis, the variety of languages and rhetoric can be used to understand the general concepts of history.
