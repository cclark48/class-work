####Defending and Lamenting History (Ch. 1)

**Traditional Historiography (p 9)**

-History can only be obtained through documents. If there are no documents, there is no history (p 10)

-Goal: remove the self; Result: objectivity

-Interpretations must grow out of the facts, and conversely, interpretations should not be substantiated by facts. If the historian starts with theories or arguments before diving into research, then the sources cannot accurately speak for themselves (p 15)

-Modern questions cannot be asked of old material; only questions that people of the past would have asked can be applied to their documents (p 19)

**Critics of Traditional Historiography (p 18)**

-“The past is not an objet of sense perception that can be experienced empirically in the present” (p 18)

-History is not the retrieval of the past, but an inference of the past (p 19)

-The past is understood differently from the ways in which it was experienced (p 19)

-Modern questions *should* be asked of old material (p 20)

-Historians aren’t judges, facts are not independent of interpretations, and the meaning of events can change over time (p 21)

**Maybe We Should Go Back to Tradition (p 23)**

-If we adhere to post structuralism, then no historical interpretation can be valued over another. Then history falls apart, and people start proposing that the holocaust never happened (p 23) 

####Anglo-American Philosophy and the Historians (Ch. 2)

**Popper and Hempel (p 30)**

-History isn’t causal explanations, but interpretation (p 30)

-Prediction is testing hypothesis, not telling the future (p 31)

-History has the potential to be science (p 32)

**Arthur Danto (p 34)**

-History shouldn’t be degraded simply because perfect knowledge cannot be obtained (p 35)

-The significance of events is attained when they become historical. Meaning is hidden from those experiencing the event. *(Note: does this mean that historians in the future will better understand the time we are currently living in better than ourselves?) (p 35)*

**Hilary Putnam (p 37)**

-Internal realism: a middle ground stating that the mind “neither copies nor invents a world” (p 38)

-Truth is that which is most rational to believe (p 38)

####Language and Structures (Ch. 3)

**Structural Linguistics (p 44)**

-Language works because it has boundaries (p 45)

-Non-verbal signs should be understood as language (p 46)

-Reality is known through its construction, established through intralinguistic differences (p 47) 

**Lévi-Strauss (p 47)**

-The task: communication and human integration (p 48)

-History studies man across time, anthropology studies man across space (p 53)

-Historical facts are derived by the historian because they are selected, incomplete, and always partial since they can never be experienced (p 54)

-History is one code among many (57)

**Critiques (p 55)**

-Speech should not be favored over writing (p 57)

-Speech as a form of writing instead of writing as a form of speech (p 57)

-There is an element of freedom and individuality in language (p 59)

-The difference between a work as ‘production’, and a work as ‘consumption’, lies in whether or not it was analyzed and interpreted (p 61)
