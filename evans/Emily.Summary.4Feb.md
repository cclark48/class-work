THE HISTORY OF HISTORY

Medievalists: Chronicling that which God intended to happen (p 13)

Romantics: History was interesting because it was different. You did history so that you remembered (p 14)

Leopold Van Ranke: 1) History as a unique discipline separate from philosophy or literature; 2) The past cannot be judged by the standards of the present; 3) Evaluate the authenticity of documents (p 14-15). His writings are part of the periodic table for history in that they may have been created over a century ago but nonetheless are still a major cornerstone for modern day historical practice.  His writings inspired others to see history as something wherein all the historical facts were present, and if the historian could use the scientific method and also remove him or her from any personal bias, then the facts would become intelligible on their own (p 17)

Inaugurated the movements of history as seen as a science, which angered some such as Trevelyan who believed that more facts doesn’t make better history which was instead a process of research, presentation, and imagination (p 21)

Popularity of the nationalist historian (p 22-23) which were shaken with WWI (p 24) and the belief is historical objectivity struggled; if the present was so difficult to understand then the past should be no different (p 25)

Perspective gained importance after the discovery of the theory of relativity in 1913 leading historians to believe that any historical writing was inevitably colored by the author/the present and told more about the time in which it was written than the time in that which is was written about (p 26)

Namier ushered in a new method of writing history that was painfully detailed oriented, but left readers feeling overwhelmed with information instead of a better understanding and could be seen as an attempt to return to objectivity (p 29)

Invasion of social sciences into history (are they any different?) along with other studies (p 32); split between “traditional” and “scientific” history (p 33). History was attempting to make hypothesis, but this was problematic because this was making historians work within a paradigm (p 36)

HISTORY, SCIENCE, AND MORALITY

Just because history is a practice of man studying man doesn’t mean that it isn’t a science, because this would mean that biology and the like would have to be excluded as well (p 40)

The argument that historical discovery does not build upon itself like scientific discovery can be refuted, but it in fact is cumulative because historians are encouraged to fill in the gaps of history through the reevaluation of sources or through the discovery of new ones (p 42)

Historians by no means need to pass judgment on the past; there job is not to condone or condemn but to evaluate the process (p 42) which, if it be morally wrong, will speak for itself (p 45). 

History is not a science of replication, but of observation (p 45)

History’s inability to create laws, and thus predict the future, but then again, neither does geology. Distinguish between generalizations and laws (p 50)

History might be confused as literature because historians are often times forced to use the same language as literature to articulate their points (p 56)

We shouldn’t underestimate metaphor’s ability to illuminate the past, but should only be used if indeed they aid in understanding (p 58)
