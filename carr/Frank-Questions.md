Carrâ€™s views on both an entirely deterministic history and a non-objective history appear incompatible. How do we make sense of a history that is wholly determined by concrete cases yet also deny that that chains of causes leads to an objective line of history that is in fact the case? 

What does Carr see history as progressing toward?

What traces of Carr do we still see in contemporary history? Differences?
