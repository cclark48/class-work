How might Carr view the fractured nature of contemporary history? How does Evans attempt to respond to this fracturing? 

In the chapter entitled Society and Individual, Evans again backs against the postmodern critiques of history. What specifically is Evans fearful will result from a postmodern history? 

On page 158 Evans says the postmodern critique has been, in a way, liberating to social historians. How is this focus on language helpful to social historians? Can it go too far? 

Is Evans pro-social history? 

I also have another question which kept popping up while we were reading the whole book which I figure I will lay on the table here. Evans, as well as Carr and Bloch, have focused on history in the academic sense, that is, the way we teach it and study it in universities. We have already discussed how the way we teach history in university classrooms presupposes certain foundations for how history ought to be practiced. In what ways do the ways in which we teach history in a pre-universtiy setting, (primary and secondary schools) presuppose their own ways of doing history and what history is? And do we want these presuppositions to be propagated?
