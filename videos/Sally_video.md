I am thinking of doing my video on the Tudor Era

I would have different ways people have looked at it (potential ideas)
  * The feminist perspective and the wives of King Henry VIII
  * Structuralists Theories
  * Post Modern theories 
  * looking at the Great Men of History idea
  * how buildings and architecture in the courts played a role
  
I was thinking the video would be a combination of pictures and text over music. 
  * I was also thinking of having immportant text highlighted (for example highlighted from a book) from each view I present. 

I find the Tudor Era fascinating and would love to learn how specific people and events have been viewed, and see if it changes my perception on anything 

The point would be to show that history has many sides to it, and depending on how you look at it, your perceptions and beliefs can change

I'm not quite sure what the main message would be other than stating how I used to look at the subject, and how I view the subject now.
