##### Lament over history 

I like Neitcha's lament over history, how it turned people into walking encylopedia's. He thought the study should be abandoned altogether in favor or art. I also like the lament over history that it is written by people in a library rather than people who were there. I like La Capra's lament, that documents are not more 'real' than literature and that historian's shouldn't approach their object in purely objectified manner. 
##### Political methods? 

Clark is on the defense against claims that literature>history is a conservative outlook. For one, when someone in historiography claims a particular method is embraced by conservative thinkers I imagine a collective jaw drop within the discipline. "Well, I'll be." 

Clark is able to defend against these claims. For example, she dispels this criticism surrounding Foucault by illustrating that Foucault's focus on discontinuities in history is derived from Marx. 

Clark really succeeds at introducing and dispelling these attack's on the effectiveness of literature, literary theory, and therefore the "linguist turn." 

##### Literature v History 

Literature and art do too many things to refine it into the purlieu of any political ideology -- much less a conservative one. 

In my last post I mentioned how *For Whom The Bell Tolls* and *Light in August* are better remembered today than their history book counterparts. The same for Hugo and the French Revolution or Goethe's *Faust* and enlightenment Europe. These guys were actually there, which says a lot to me. Not some historian holed up in a musky university library drudging through archives for "facts." 

*Light in August*, for its part, is an intense critique of the justice system and racial constructs in post civil war South. More can be gleaned from it, regarding culture, class, sex, race, law and religion than can be even touched on in a book about the topic written by a historian. 

Are we to believe that studying Klaus Mann's revitalization of the Faustian myth in his book *Mephisto* is a part of this conservative embrace? 

Essentially, Clark is correcting this misconception about literature but on a more heady level, literary theory and how it can be applied to historical texts. 

Life is merely a stage full of characters, after all, and our history is told through these plays. 

I was surprised at Clark's coldness towards context, however. 

##### Graveyard of philosophy 

In my experience: I've learned more about 17th century England culture through Shakespeare courses than I did through history courses because we read them via context of the culture at the time. Plays such as "Winters Tale" and "Othello" provide tons of historical context. 

I liked Geertz a lot, and I agree again with him here. Texts are to interpret, not ciphers to solve. And from the micro we can comprise a macro. 

I don't think literature and interpretative anthropology are mutually exclusive. A blend of the two produces my favorite book's - e.g., Jack Weatherford's *Ghenghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World.* A gripping narrative that made the best seller list - another thing historian's hate. 

The study's current is taking it somewhere for sure but the question is where. 

A social science, anthropology, literature? Or it will continue to be history, becoming its subject altogether, vanishing away into a blurry past in the graveyard of philosophy.
