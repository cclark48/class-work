####HIST 491-Final Project Proposition

I am just beginning to write my honors thesis on prostitution in 18th & 19th century Paris and London, so for the final project in this class I am planning to do a historiographical analysis of prostitution in (just) London within the same time period. Specifically, I want to research the ways in which Jack the Ripper and other violence committed against prostitutes was portrayed in the media at the time, and how this has affected historiographical research of the topic in the following years. 

#####Some Potential Sources

-“The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon”- Series of newspaper articles discussing prostitution in London

-Scotland Yard and how the Letters were incorporated into Newspapers 

-"The Yorkshire Ripper" – modern day example of how history was incorporated into current events to sensationalize the topic

-Examine  the ways in which this historical event was understood in later generations by: Leonard W. Matters (1929), Daniel Farson (1973), Deborah Camerona and Elizabeth Fraser (1987) 

-"The East End Atrocities" *London City Mission Magazine* (1888)
