1. sstory1 commented on how reading primary documents in the language they were written in is importnat when deciphering the true concepts being put forth by the authror. Considering how difficult it can sometimes be to communicate with others within the same language in the same time period, do you believe it is even remotely possible to glimpse at an objective reality of the past when complicated by many more factors? How would you define the objective realityb of today?
2. JR Oppenheim comments how history should be viewed as a continum rather than independents events. If this concept is to be followed, how does the historian distinguish when to 'stop' his analysis going back into the past? If all dates were refered to only by thier context, how could time periods be compared across regions? This concept is built on further by mandymartie, who comments how the century system clouds the historian's view of true causes. Even if this is true, with out the century system, how would historical evens be situated within time?
