Chapter Four is titled “The territory of the historian” but is there really a territory that is strictly for history. Throughout this class we have pulled ideas from anthropology, philosophy, art, science, and theory; is there really a field that is strictly just history? Is there a way to just practice history? and how would we do that? 


Presentist and whig history, These are negative terms in the practice of history and used to criticize the Annales in chapter 4. Why is this negative? as we have talked about we want to use history as a tool to influence the future. So how do we practice history without being presentist? 


“The ancients, many scholars now concede, saw history as a species of literature-a claim that makes ancient history-writing readily amenable to aspects of recent literary critique 42.” This statement brought up issues of truth in history, if history lays in the same genre as literature can it hold the same truth? how is historical writing so distinctively different, that we can call it literature?
