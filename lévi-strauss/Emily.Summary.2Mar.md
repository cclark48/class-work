###Myth and Science 

#####Myth is to structuralism as science is to reductionism

-Structuralism- ‘explaining’ at the highest level means you explain all things below, which is everything

-Reductionism- if multiple scientists ‘explain’ at the smallest unit, they will eventually explain enough small units to       explain the whole
    
#####Nature has a limited number of procedures

-The procedures used at one level are likely to reappear in another

-Take for example the similarity between language and genetics; similar rules apply

-Science helps us understand myths, because often the same procedures are used in each (the skate and computers)
    
#####The broadening of Science to include the senses 

-But science will never be ‘complete’, just as history can never be ‘complete’

###Myth and the Mind

#####The ‘primitive’ mind

-Utilitarian conception vs. Affective conception (theirs is an inferior kind of thought vs. a different kind of thought)

-Cultures develop different skill sets for their environment dictated by what they need

-Myth does not give man more power over his environment, but he has the illusion of understanding it 

#####Homogenization

-True homogenization cannot occur, because if exterior barrios weaken, interior barrios with strengthen
Myth and History 

#####Differences in Expression

-History uses documents as its source; Myth uses the spoken word as its source

-No story, whether it be through history or in myth, is ever exactly the same. As long as the outcome is the same (generally speaking), we are content with focusing on what is mostly similar

-Myth as a closed system, history as an open system 

-The goal for both: help the future to remain faithful to the present and the past

###Myth and Music 

-Fiction and music grew from the disappearance of myth in culture 

#####Understanding Myth and Music 

-Myth must be read and understood holistically, its elements will appear in sequences repeated through out (like a melody in music) 

-You must use your memory to understand the variations in melody/myth
