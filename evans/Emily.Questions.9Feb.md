Do you agree with Evan’s distinction between facts and evidence on page 66? Why or why not?

Evans elaborates on the death of the gingerbread salesman to illustrate his example of fact versus evidence, stating that this historical fact (which might not even be a fact upon closer inspection) was used as evidence to support a point that, had the author done more research on the circumstance of the “fact”, would not support his hypothesis. Similarly, Evans brings up the Abraham affair, which is concerned with the same issues. Have you ever misused or misunderstood information, and how do you think this happened?

Evans discusses the multiple ways in which a document can be understood and stresses the importance of “reading against the grain”. In what ways do you think that you read against the grain? What personal characteristics might make you vulnerable to the skewing of documents, and in what ways could they be misunderstood? 

Evans mentions the post-modern concept that there is no difference between a primary and secondary source. How would you sum up this argument? In addition, how effective do you believe language to be? Is it fairly accurate and reliable? Or is it merely the best option available to us for communication and used out of necessity, but retains irrecoverable fundamental flaws?
