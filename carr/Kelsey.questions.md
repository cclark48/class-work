1. In discussing Bloch's writing a few weeks ago we debated on history as a science. 
Now that we have read more into the relationship between history and science in Carr's writing, do you change your
original stand-point? 

2. Carr describes a historian's job as being "universal". Do you agree with him?
Do you agree that there is a "universal" and uniform way for a hisorian to carry out and present their craft?

3. Carr promotes increasing individualization in order to expand our reasoning. 
What do you think we as historians should do in order to widen our horizons?
