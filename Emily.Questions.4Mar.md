Do you think that activities such as the Balinese cock fight count as a historical fact? And by historical fact, this can be Carr’s definition, or any of the other definitions discussed in class. 

Geertz considers the Balinese cock fight to be a form of text (on page 83). Why do you think he defines it as such? How can it be used as a historical text, and why should it be considered as such?

Should the cultural significance of the Balinese cockfight be considered a ‘history’ or a ‘myth’?  Does it matter if it is history or myth if it provides a deeper understanding of a culture?

Geertz’s article highlights some of the benefits to studying a culture anthropologically, where it can be experienced in real time. How large of a disadvantage is it that historians cannot ever experience the time/culture they are studying? Or is this in fact a benefit because time, in a way, seems to sort out the truth within experience?
