  Bloch uses Ranke's formula: the historian has no other aim than to describe things "as they happened." Bloch goes on to explain the difficulties inherent in this process: historical figures have multiple roles and documents from an historical figure's diary will look like a completely different person when compared to his political correspondence; every generation and every place has a "different system of consciously accepted moral values" that a historian must analyze from the standpoint of his own system; there is "no system of symbols unconnected with national language," unlike math and chemestry; nomenclature which is used to describe things of the past will always distort these things. So, with all the problems, is it even conceivable for an historian to be able to describe things "as they happened?" Isn't a more realistic formula for historical analysis necessary?

  Contrary to Bloch's view, is it not better for an historian to be both a scholar and a judge? I believe judgement is a necessary part of analysis. Part of history is an exercise in morality. Taking judgements of morality out of the study of people in time greatly reduces our ability to understand both the past and the present. As long as an historian has the ability to understand that which he judges, wouldn't this judgement give more clarity to the study of people in time?
