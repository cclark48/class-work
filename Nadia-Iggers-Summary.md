In the first part of “Historiography,” Iggers details the many changes in historical studies, beginning with the moment when it officially became a discipline in the early 20th century.  He focusses on the development of historical schools all around the world and how the advent of nationalism and culture within a specific nation affect the development of these schools. For example, the various schools that originated in the United States affirmed modernity and a democratic social order, putting the U.S. at the epicenter of social progress. At the beginning of history as a discipline, the preferred model was that of Ranke, who prioritized political history and emphasized the importance of Western culture. World and social history had almost no place in this model.
However, as with anything else, opposing views emerged as equally respectable historical schools. For example, the Annales school in France acted as a direct response to the Ranke model. In their work, there was almost no mention of political history, and they had their own idea of what constitutes history and how it should be studied. This emergence of new schools of thought in response to existing ones was another important aspect that Iggers focused on. Another visible example of this was what emerged from the originally vague writings of Marx and Engels. Not only did they perpetuate centuries of interpretation of their own work, but they also enabled the flourishing of many critiques. This demonstrates the importance of new, challenging thought and discussion surrounding it because one never knows what will lead to a breakthrough in academia.
