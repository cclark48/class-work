"What is history?" 

That seems to be the prevalent theme throughout this book (clearly, since it is the title). But just as Carr suggests, its answer
is so much more complex than initially thought. Carr brings forth an excellent examination of this point, and in my opinion, more
clearly summarizes the role of historians.

What truly struck me throughout this piece is Carr's attempts to bring our awareness to the innate bias in our craft. We had a 
fairly in depth discussion analyzing bias particularly in Bloch's book. I believe this comes forward as Bloch sugggests complete 
unbias could be achieved. We argued the merits of Bloch's hypocrisy, attempting to analyze where he went wrong. Yet, Carr offers
forth absolution, for Bloch and all historians alike that we cannot avoid the innate influences that affect our work. Whist read-
ing this particular section, I found myself agreeing with so much he was dicussing, as he put into words so many of the qualms 
I have had with studying history. I found his disucssions concerning the interp. of historial facts through historians to be quite
profound. I had never truly realized how evident this was, but it is quite clear once you think about it. We act as lens, through
which society can see into the past. But their are limits we must be aware of. 

Particularly with the bias, a major component of our work is completely dependent on the work of other humans, be it their own 
memoirs, pictures, accounts, or their research. All of these pieces of evidence of history are a human product, and are thus open
to human error or bias. Just as Carr discussed, it is impossible to avoid the influences of the social context surrounding the 
production of so much of the evidence we have come to build the foundations of our knowledge of history upon. As such, I find my-
self asking, if this is the case, how can we reliably say we are legitamately understanding history? 

Additionally, Carr discusses the limits upon our ability to truly delve into the historial record and obtain the historical truth. 
I agree with Carr. In class, I said we have only scratched maybe 10% of the truth, and Carr offered some support to that claim. 
So much of the historical facts we claim to know come form such a limited source. We only have access to those who left links to
the past behind, a small fraction compared to all of those who have lived in the past. While I find the stories left behind by the
greats and elites very interesting, I find myself wondering about the lesser peoples; the everyday stories, their history. Just as
Bloch and Carr said, isn't it our job as historians to bring together all the pieces? And if we can't, how much can we truly say 
we know? 

I think, as Carr would say, the key to all of this is awareness. As long as we as historians are mindful of these baises and
influences, we can do the best we can with what we have. I think it is particulary impportant to take what Carr discusses with his
discussion of science and developng a hypothesis in that we must continue to search for the truth and see where it takes us. 
Truly, while I am pessisimistic about the scope of historial truth we have uncovered, I believe it is still quite possible to 
gain a deeper understanding of our past if we continue to understand what history is, and continue to work to find the truth.
