Evans obviously believes that the postmodernist view, or the linguistic turn is a threat to traditional historiography. His 
lengthy critique leaves me with the question of when is it fiction and when is it history? If there is a lack of common
understanding about the use and meaning of words then where does that leave civilization or culture? 
Finally at what point does history become fiction?
