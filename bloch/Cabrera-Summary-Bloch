The main points that I gathered from Chapter IV of The Historian’s Craft was the necessary aspects of describing things as they happened in the past. Bloch emphasizes the need for impartiality and understanding. One can be objective in both the way of the scholar and the judge, though Bloch warns about judging the passions of the past with the prejudices of the present. Doing so would elevate our own accepted morals and laws that are only relevant to our society to the level of supreme authority, which no Historian should pretend to possess. 

In keeping with Bloch’s constant comparisons of History to Science, he points out the restrictive (but also liberating?) nature of nomenclature, or lack thereof, in this subject. He describes the importance of appropriate language for proper analysis and how Historians must achieve this within the bounds of their own language and the best that can be done with translation. Whereas the hard sciences have their own universal language within their subject, “the private language of each historian will, together, never make up the language of History.”
