How do we account for human nature when regarding history as a science?

Bloch mentions to take ourselves out of history to stop forming biases, but isn't biases what makes history.  If we have no objectivity how will we historians know what people thought?

Bloch tries to take his biases out because he knows he is witnessing history.  How are we suppossed to know when we are involved in history and need to stay objective versus living our daily lives? Is staying objective even possible?
