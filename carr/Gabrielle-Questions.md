Carr has this theory about the common sense view of history, do you agree or disagree that there is a common sense way to do history, in terms of historical fact, is there a way that we can be factual, and to what degree are we being “ignorant” accepting facts (pg 7, and 14)?

I found hist thoughts on the individual and society interesting, he claims the CSM of history is to see an individual as the individual (41), he says this is overly simple and claims the individual created the culture. Do you agree or disagree with this (40-41)? or is the individual a product of society?

In terms of thinking as an individual as a product of society, does this change the way that you would read Primary documents written by an individual?

Carr has many ideas of a reciprocal scientific approach to history, finding similarities between theory and practice. Saying that a hypothesis is a require the same tools of thought, and history need to find basic laws to see how things work this brought me back to the first section were he defines what is fact? in your eyes does this contradict what he said in the beginning (74)? when he says that interpretation plays an important role in facts of history (31)? can interpretations become fact?
