I found the sections on Myth and Science and Myth and History to be particularly interesting to Levi-Strauss's arguememts of Myth 
and Meaning. Here's what I understodd about each section.
Myth and Science:
-Myth is to structuralism as science is to redctionism.
-You must understand pieces of something before you understand it as a whole.
-The primitive mind: there is an inferior kind of thought and a primitive or different kind.

Myth and History:
-History has replaced myth.
-History started out as writing down myths.

The first section covers the similarities and differences between myths and sciences. I personally do not see myths as being a science,
 but that may just be due to my "inferior kind of thought"- refering to Levi-Strauss's primitive mind arguement.
 I have always understood science to be the study and testing of how things work and myths to be stories of 
 why things are the way they are- but always with a lesson at the end. The main difference between the two is experiment. 
 But then again, I suppose a myth could have an experienment done in order to prove its truth, i.e Myth Busters. 
 Culture plays a huge role is defining what a science is. Educated cultures refer to science as advanced experimentation,
 where as others can have an entirerly new meaning of science or not one at all. This is where the primitive mind argument comes
 into play- he refers to the primitive mind being a simple, uneducated one. In one of my anthropology classes we refer to "primitive" 
 as our originating place, being more ape minded/like than human. But in class yesterday the point was made that apes too have science,
 it just isn't referred to as science. This science can be seen in tool making and the teaching of "human" skills
 to apes in labs. My point in this is that myth could potentially be science, depending on culuture.
 
 The second section refers to myth as the prequel of history. I do agree with this. Myths have been around since before history was 
 called history. It has been apparent in drawing on cave walls and stories passed from one generation to another. Myths today have
 taken on a more fairy-tale catergory, placing them right next to children's bed time stories and campfire legends. So is history
 a myth? Yes. Are myths history? Yes.
