Do you think these rituals are like myth? Do rituals show more into a culture them presumed?

We have connected myth with history, but do you see a clear connection between rituals and historic relevance?

In cultural anthropology this ritual of cock fighting and the importance of the cocks is very relevant to the culture, it shows values, and rules of a specific tribe. What can cock holding tell us about the history of the tribe?

In terms of patterning that we talked about with Levi-Strauss do you see a structuralist relationship between these cock fights and gabling culture in America? what does this tell us about human functionalism of gambling?

Geertz argues in the section about “social gambling,” that the social implications that come with winning a fight are a lot more important then the material prizes. How are social values effected by historical influence?
