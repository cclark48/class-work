First, Geertz talks about how people were stand offish and ignored him, but then he became one of them.  This relates to past readings about emerging oneself in the culture, as a way to understand.  Once Geertz experienced what the local people experienced, he became one of them, allowing him to be fully enveloped in the society.

He also talked about the pastime of cockfights and why it hasn't been studied aas much.  In this section he also refers to cocks as masculine. Previously, I had a read an article about how language is used.  In the article I read for another class, it was a female who had entered into a military bomb section, and she noticed that all jargon was feminised. With Geertz, the cocks as masculinized and are almost used as a metaphor, relating cocks to the males.

Relating to the second point, Geertz mentions that whoeve wins has the better cock, but this is also a metaphor, whoever wins is the "bigger" man.  
 * this becomes a status of rivalry
 * also a social prestige
 * the result of the cockfight is a result of how the community precieves you
 
Geertz then talks about how one goest about betting/gambling during a cockfight.
 * there are allies within betting and family ties

The last main section I found interesting revolved around "Deep Play".  This is immoral and bad for both parties
  * the cock is the surrogate for the owners personalities - this relates to the metaphor that the cock represents the man
  
Overall, it seemed that the overarching theme was how cockfighting affects the community and its relationship to the view of men in the society.  If a cock wins, than the owner of the cock is respected.
