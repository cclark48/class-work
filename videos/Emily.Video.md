####HIST 491-Final Project Proposition

I am just beginning to write my honors thesis on prostitution in 18th & 19th century Paris and London, so for the final project in this class I am planning to do a historiographical analysis of prostitution in (just) London within the same time period. Specifically, I want to research the ways in which Jack the Ripper and other violence committed against prostitutes was portrayed in the media at the time, and how this has affected historiographical research of the topic in the following years. 

#####Some Potential Sources

-“The Maiden Tribute”- Series of newspaper articles discussing prostitution in London

- The Yorkshire Ripper – modern day example of how history was incorporated into current events to ‘sensationalize’ the topic
