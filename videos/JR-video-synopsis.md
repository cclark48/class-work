<h2>My ideas regarding video project</h2>
<p>I've made my interest in military and war history pretty apparent throughout this semester. For me, personally, I see wars as a microcosm of every form of history one can research -- cultural, social, economical, great men, recapping of events, religion, etc. This became especially apparent in with concept of total war, first seen in the American Civil War but more broadly understood in the First World War. With that in mind, I intend to produce a video discussing the historiography of war history. Here are my thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brief examination of Thucydides, whose account of the Peloponnesian War is considered the first war history</li>
<li>A quick recap discussing some of the major conflicts throughout history and how they were examined</li>
<li>Waterloo. One war historian who comes to mind, John Keegan, apparently sees this battle as the major shift in conflift. I want to examine why.</li>
<li>Total war, and how historiography changed. Based on what we've read and discussed, both World Wars radically changed the way people approach history in general, not just war history.</li>
<li>Concluding with the 20th century being among the most violent in history. Here, I plan to discuss why studying war history is relevant.</li>
</ul>
