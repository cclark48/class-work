I can't help but notice, in my opinion, the main point of this book is that in the same with the main point of Joan Scott's article we read on gender. Which leaves us with the same question: how did we get here? Are myth and science inseprable? Or can science help us not only explain everyday things in life but also help us gain an explanation for myths we still don't have answers to. 
Personally I like to keep myths in the same category as magic, fairys and the fabled creatures of old which almost all cultures have stories and tales of which predate the 17th century (when science took over). Do you think that magic and myths may really just be science that we just don't understand yet?
