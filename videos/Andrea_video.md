To be honest I am a little torn between two options. 

On the one hand I am fairly passionate about the way I think that history should be taught and the uses that I see for it in our society. Mostly I think that the *key* to understanding our present is to know, recognize, and acknowledge our past as much as we are able to. We don’t have to **understand** it necessarily to use it to our advantage.  

My other thought is I want to see if I can find the historiographical information about the words **Aztec** and *Mexica*. I want to know when and who chose to refer to the *Mexica* as **Aztecs** in their histories. I want to find out, if possible, why they made this choice that has now impacted the system so much that most people don’t even know who the *Mexica* are, but the **Aztecs** everyone knows them…

I had a third thought since we talked about the disapeared ones at the end of class the other day and I'm pretty passionate about that subject but I thought it's probaby about time I decide and not complicate things with more options. 

There is a good chance I will end up choosing what I think needs to be done in teaching history just because finding more on the *Mexica* thing is already proving to be somewhat challenging. Either way I am sure it will be *magical.* Also I want to maybe try that writing stuff in my video I think it looks fun. Perhaps, I will also add some **epic** soundtrack to add gravity to the super serious nature of my film.
