To what extent should a country emphasize its own history?

Evans pokes quite a few holes in Carr’s arguments. Would you say that Carr was wrong (or less correct) or does his writing simply reflect the thought and knowledge at the time?

What does Evans mean by “postmodernists”? This is still confusing.
