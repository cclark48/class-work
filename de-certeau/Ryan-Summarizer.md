Almost overly elloquent but the eloquence brings along good imagery as it focuses on our routine practices as human beings.
Touches on the ways in which people individualize mass culture. From practical objects to street plans to rituals, laws and laguage, in order to law claim to them or make them their own.
He focuses on strategy versus tactics. Repression vs expression. Strategies are imposed by those within, which are the power structures (corporations, states, and scientitsts.) they are deployed against some external entity to institute a set of relations. Tactics are employed by the subjugated. Thus the tactics are defensive and opportunistic.
The consumers of the power structures are the individuals while the institutions and structures of power are the producers. The individuals are the now in an environment defined by strategy using tactics employed by the producers.
His vantage point from the world trade center illustrates the idea of a unified view, whereas the walker he mentions move in a way that is tactical and never determined by the intended plans of the bodies whom organized them. 

Main Argument:
every day life works by a process of paching on the territory of others, using the rules and products that already exist in culture in a way that is unified, but never wholly determined, by those rules and products. Just because a government or institution puts a label on a place doesn't meant its subject to that categorization from that day forward, for it as a place may mean something completely different to another individual, government or set of institutions.

it personally makes me think of the most disputed land in the history of human existence: Jerusalem/Israel. So many different labels have been put on this land and yet the place/space it resides means something different to millions of individuals.
