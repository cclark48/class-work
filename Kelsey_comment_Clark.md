I am conflicted on whether or not Clark’s novel qualifies as a suitable historiography text or not. I fell that it fits well with our course curriculum because it adds a unique spin to our study of why we study history. Clark is able to capture the essence of historiography in a light that none of the other novels we have read have been able to do. She discusses history and its disciplines in not the most glamorous of lights but in a way that makes me think that it is currently undergoing a remodeling phase (and has been since recording history became a thing.) Clark uses past influences to show how history has veered in different directions and directly quotes many of history’s biggest critics. I enjoyed reading about the critiques because many of them I had never been exposed to before. Her novel has both enlightened me and confused me about history as a discipline. History as a narrative, as a timeline, as a science and mythology, Clark discusses it all. 
She lost me however at the end with her section on premodern text. Personally I felt she could have done a way better job at tying together the surplus of loose ends in her novel. I say loose ends meaning her critiques and arguments mentioned throughout the text. I enjoyed them, but I kept waiting for a big point to be made that connected me with why she felt the need to use so many arguments. Instead the last section of her novel left me with a ton of knowledge about early Christian text but perhaps I misunderstood her use of early religious text as premodern history text. Clark did not leave me a clear notion of historiography as the other novels have.
