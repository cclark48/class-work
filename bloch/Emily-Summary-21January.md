DEDICATION 
French author, writing during the outset of the second world war (mentions that he is writing merely from memory with none of his materials).

INTRODUCTION (P 3).
Begins by pointing out that western culture has had a longstanding interest in its past, mainly because it is a culture deeply tied to Christianity, which in itself is a religion of history (P 4).
Mere interest and curiosity cannot explain this tradition of history, so therefore it must serve some purpose or use, but what might this be? (p 7).
History is seen as a guiding force, but when it fails to do so, we become resentful (p 11).
Blochâ€™s goal: explain how and why a historian practices his trade (p 12).

CHAPTER I -  HISTORY, MEN, AND TIME (p 20).
THE CHOICE OF THE HISTORIAN (p 20).
2. HISTORY AND MEN (p 22)
- Two opposing schools to historical thought: 1) history as a science of human evolution; 2) aimless knowledge not intended to shed light on the present, or illuminate the future 
- History defined as change taking place in time (p 23)
- At any moment in time, there are multiple influences converging into one point of time and space. History can be distinguished as the introduction of the human element (p 25)
- One major difficulty in history is adequately expressing fragile topics that in many instances, we might not even posses the adequate vocabulary to do so (p 27)
3. HISTORICAL TIME (p 27)
- To understand history is to understand that reality is a state subject to the unstoppable and ever moving force of time (p 27)
4. THE IDOL OF ORIGINS 
- Historians can all to easily use the past as a means to justify the present, and not as a genuine search for truth (p 31)
- We loose the true understanding of words, and are left only with the concepts that we know to be true today (p 34) 
5. THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN PAST AND PRESENT
- The studies of the present are really no different from the studies of the past, aside from the fact that individuals necessarily are better acquainted with the time being studied if it is today
6. UNDERSTANDING THE PRESENT BY THE PAST (p 39) 
- History is cumulative and can only be properly understood with the knowledge of the preceding moment
7. UNDERSTANDING THE PAST BY THE PRESENT (p 43)
- It is by taking what we understand and know about life today that the past can be fleshed (p 44)
- History is animating the dead with the knowledge of the living (p 47)

CHAPTER II -  HISTORICAL OBSERVATION (p 48)
1. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF HISTORICAL OBSERVATION (p 48)
- Sine we ourselves cannot observe the historical events being studied, the historian is left to the same tools that a police officer is when reconstructing a crime scene (p 48)
- It is not observing an event through the eyes of another, but examining all that is left behind (p 54)
2. EVIDENCE
- Documentation should not be taken at face value, and instead evaluated for the purposes it was meant to serve. With out such prerequisite knowledge, the history would be subject to all the same delusions and prejudices of the time he is studying (p 62)
3. THE TRANSMISSION OF EVIDENCE 
- The most evidence is lost through the peaceable transition of time that lets memory and evidence silently slip away (p 74) 
- Secrets do incredible damage to the understanding of the past. In the modern day, it is understandable that certain transactions and the like need be kept private. However, after that time has passed, this information serves the most purpose if it is made public, and senselessly kept secrets deny deeper understanding (p 76)
