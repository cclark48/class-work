Levi Strauss makes a lengthy argunemnt that history has replaced myth up through chapter 4. Is it truly a valid argument or is he connecting one function of history with a utility of myth?

Does one need to live in the environment of the story teller to understand the myth? In other words, does context add anything to the myth?

Is there more application of causation in myth than in history?
