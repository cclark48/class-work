Carr makes the comment that history should be free of judgments and only tell the facts.  However, isn't all history biased? Isn't bias what makes history?  If someone wrote down what they felt about an event, should we as historians not mention how they felt and just relay the facts?

There was a quote that said, "History of the Victorian Age will never be written because we know too much about it"  Do historians tend to research events that we don't know as much about?  Although there is a plethora of work on the Holocaust, but do historians still research intensively about it, or do they look, but not research as much as they would about the beggining of time?

Much of the first few chapters is Evans laying the ground work, however, there is a quote that says only historians are able to talk about history.  Does that mean that everybody in their own way is a historian? Also, what is Evan's opinon about this as we read the book?
