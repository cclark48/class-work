For my final video project I am thinking of discussing the historiography of feminist studies. I would mostly like to look at the scholarly work that progressed through the different focuses of feminism and what lead feminist groups to begin to include women of color, bisexual and lesbian women in their agendas for equality. I think I will focus on 19th, 20th, 21st centuries and future feminist studies and why it remains important as a discipline.
